## General tips

### Starting out

If you're a new player (or about to start playing), I have the following recommendations:
* Don't pick Volt as your starting frame.
* Join a clan (gets you access to Volt).
* The moment you hit mastery rank 4, get the Hek blueprint from the market and build it. It'll carry you well.
* Buy every MK1 from the market in turn, level them to 30 and throw them in the bin.
* Check what weapons are required as ingredients for other weapons before you throw away any of them [here](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons_Required_as_Crafting_Ingredients).
* Get a Kuva Nukor when you can (you won't regret it).
* Don't spend plat on something you could earn by just playing the game.
* Don't sell non-prime frames if you get the prime variant. Get the helminth segment instead and subsume the frame

### Late-game tips

* Perspicacity from helminth at rank 3 is useful for sorties. Allows you to hack panels without doing the minigame (because ciphers do not work).
* Golden Instinct from helminth at rank 15 is useful for general content. Helps find you ayatan sculptures and rare crates.
* Get galvanized mods from arbitration and arcanes from steel path to boost any primary/secondary weapon you own.

## Making Plat

### Granum Void farming

#### Overview
Mode: solo

Requirements: must have completed [The Deadlock Protocol](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Deadlock_Protocol)

Recommended (fastest) nodes: Skyresh (Phobos, normal), Fossa (Venus, normal, coincides with Jackal), Adresta (Jupiter, extended), Hydra (Pluto, nightmare)

Recommended setup: Mesa with Arcane Velocity + decent energy + some decent damage on the regulators.

Reward table can be found [here](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Granum_Void#Rewards).

Market links: [Stropha](https://warframe.market/items/stropha_set) [Velox](https://warframe.market/items/velox_set) [Stahlta](https://warframe.market/items/stahlta_set)

Assuming you can do 15 runs per hour: will yield about 115 plat per hour (this includes selling sets, accounts for cosmetic and Protea-drops)

#### Details
Running anything but solo makes enemy spawns more random and inconsistent (I didn't fail a single attempt in solo) + the required kill count increases by 25 for each player present. In solo it is possible to beat the challenge on any difficulty within roughly 30 seconds as a solo Mesa. Jump onto any small hill and get your auto-aim focus area tiny and drag it between the 3-4 spots the enemies will keep spawning in.

Playing as mesa also trivialises killing the treasurer.
The treasurer will spawn 2-5 minutes into the mission. If he hasn't spawned by the time you reach the end, just wait by the extraction point, he'll show up eventually.

The disadvantage of running solo is that you won't be able to run a surplus of crowns.

You can see a successful nightmare (top level) run [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cposSpiwYeo).

### Requiem Mods

Requirements: must have completed [The War Within](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/The_War_Within)

You can easily farm requiem mods from hunting [liches](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Kuva_Lich) and cracking [relics dropped from their thralls](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Relic#Requiem_Relics).

The requiem mods sell for 10-15 plat each.
