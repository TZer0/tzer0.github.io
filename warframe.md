Assuming you can do 15 runs per hour: will yield about 115 plat per hour (this includes selling sets, accounts for cosmetic and Protea-drops)

#### Details
Running anything but solo makes enemy spawns more random and inconsistent (I didn't fail a single attempt in solo) + the required kill count increases by 25 for each player present. In solo it is possible to beat the challenge on any difficulty within roughly 30 seconds as a solo Mesa. Jump onto any small hill and get your auto-aim focus area tiny and drag it between the 3-4 spots the enemies will keep spawning in.

Playing as mesa also trivialises killing the treasurer.
The treasurer will spawn 2-5 minutes into the mission. If he hasn't spawned by the time you reach the end, just wait by the extraction point, he'll show up eventually.

The disadvantage of running solo is that you won't be able to run a surplus of crowns.
