# Music software I recommend

Unfortunately, music software is in general rather pricey. I will therefore be splitting up this by price and then by type.

First of all, my DAW is [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/). Costs 68 EUR/75 USD for a license that lasts more than a decade in terms of updates. The demo for Renoise is extremely generous as it lets you save project files (but not export them to a playable format). This means that if you make something cool before buying it, you can render it once you have a license.

## Free

### Synths
- [Synth1](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-daichi-laboratory-ichiro-toda) - Looks a bit ugly, but has a lot of functionality and is a fun little synth to muck about with, especially when new to making music.
- [The ODOsynths archive](https://theodosynthsarchive.wordpress.com/) - Collection of synths. Highly recommend 38911Bytes for making weird retro-sounding sounds.

### Effects
- [Variety of Sound](https://varietyofsound.wordpress.com/) - Collection of sound effects. TesslaSE and epicVerb are in my opinion effects that easily could've been sold for a decent amount of money, but the maker has decided to make all of these effects free.

## Relatively Cheap
You'll see why I call this relatively cheap in the next section.

### Synths
- [FXpansion Strobe2](https://www.fxpansion.com/products/strobe2/) - In my opinion this is one of the best synths out there. Easy to get into due to a great layout, visualisers, and intuitive parameter modulation, incredible depth despite the intuitive nature.
- [FXpansion Cypher2](https://www.fxpansion.com/products/cypher2/) - Same as Strobe2, but more focused on frequency modulation and waveshaping. Slightly harder to use.
- [Arturia Pigments](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/pigments#en) - A combo synth combining wavetable, sampling, and subtractive synths into one package. Has similarly easy modulation options as the former.


## Expensive

### Synths

- [Arturia V Collection](https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/v-collection/overview#en) - Digital recreations of many classic synths in one big package.
