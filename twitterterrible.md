# Twitter is a Terrible Platform

## Twitter is Bad for Discourse

I'm writing this to encourage anyone reading to be cautious around ambiguous discourse on Twitter. If you see someone make unambiguously bigoted statements then those should still be called out.
Please assume good faith.

I won't be mentioning any names because they're honestly not important.

I don't think anyone in particular in what I'm describing did anything exceptionally bad, this is more about Twitter as a platform and what it facilitates.

### The Case

I'd like to talk about this tweet from a leftist content creator and the reactions it got:
> If your primary enemy is "breadtubers" or content creator X then you're not really attacking anyone who wields any actual power.
> 
> You just hate an e-celeb. In which case fair dues but it's not exactly revolutionary action 

There are in my opinion three statements here and I'd like to explore how this went wrong in the discourse.
1. Don't make "breadtubers" your primary enemy.
2. These "breadtubers" don't hold "actual power".
3. Attacking e-celebs is not revolutionary action, but you can still do it.

### The Readings

First of all, I want to point out that "breadtuber" is a sort of ill-defined term as it is a label applied to leftist anarchist-leaning content creators (and sometimes not even anarchist-leaning ones) by viewers rather one that has been claimed by the content creators themselves. This however doesn't matter in this discussion and I'll be using the term below.

I'd like to examine how meaning gets absolutely destroyed as the tweet above gets quote-tweeted and misread.

Point 1 was read as "don't criticise" by several people quote tweeting this tweet. Any good-faith reading of it would assume "don't make it your primary endevour thing to criticise breadtubers". The person tweeting this knows full well that there are antagonisms between breadtubers and it specifies "primary enemy". You can still according to the tweeter view someone who is another person that is anarchist-leaning + leftist-leaning as an enemy.

Point 2 was read as "breadtubers don't actually hold power". The good-faith reading of this would be "breadtubers don't hold actual power relative to for instance elected officials" because it is pretty obvious that someone with even 10 k subscribers holds some power - just not the power to for instance escape jail-time for crimes. Could someone with 100 k subscribers harass someone off the Internet? Incite some nastiness? Absolutely. Could they defund trans healthcare in their region or get homeless people arrested? Not so much.

Point 3 was generally not remarked upon and is hence in my opinion not that important to what we're discussing.

One tweet even referenced a major fash-sympathetic Youtuber in a response to this tweet.

### The Problems and How Twitter makes it Worse

First of all, context of the tweet.

The original tweet wasn't addressed to anyone and thus ends up being about a nebulous "they" (please note that this is different from when a conspiracy theorist talks about "them").

Who is this "they" in this context? Who is this tweet about? Is it leftist critics of content creator A or is it bad-faith smearers of content creator B? Who knows. This tweet relates to the person's subjective experience of a situation that probably isn't representative of the people they think they're addressing as a whole.

This particular fault lies somewhat with the creator of the tweet, but Twitter makes this worse. The format of twitter forces your opinions into small blocks of 280 characters and discussions end up in many different places that are impossible to follow - quote tweets, responses, screencaps. This impacts how you write, what you prioritise and what you will provide in terms of references. If you add an addendum to your tweet, such as clarifying regarding point 1. that you actually think it is 100% fair to view a breadtuber as enemy, the people who have already quote tweeted you may never even see it or perhaps view it as you trying to explain away the bad thing you said rather than clarifying as it would be seen on any other platform or in a conversation in real life. This is a problem that Twitter helps create due to Twitter not being in any way threaded. Things are also easier to take out of context (even accidentally!), you may clarify, people might see just the quote tweets and not even investigate the original tweet and any possible clarifications underneath.

Furthermore, the discussion-spread and non-channeled way of discussion leads to some other problems. One big advantage of platforms that let you do chat with othersin real-time is that you can respond to questions or skip over already known things. On Twitter, you may err on the side of caution and accidentally overexplain something which may come off as condescending or skip over something due to space constraints that you thought was already widely known that someone else thought you absolutely should mention.

### What Should You do about this?

The following applies to everyone: my recommendation is to stay away from any potentially controversial ambiguous statements or point out how it is ambiguous and ask what the person in question meant. Even if it is someone who you otherwise dislike, you should still attempt a good faith reading of what's being said and perhaps ask for clarification rather than quote tweeting a dunk.

If you are a content creator, avoid Twitter for anything but promoting your videos and dealing with unambiguous topics. If you wish to address something where the context can be hard to discern for others or can be read in any number of ways, make a TwitLonger, a medium post, or a video and make sure to clarify things.

## Technical Aspects of Twitter

### `?s=XX`
If you are sharing a link, make sure to trim away the last part of the URL (if it exists) that says `?s=XX` where `XX` is a number such as `?s=21`. This gets prepended when you share a link from mobile and changes how the tweet is viewed on desktop if opened. Rather than showing you the tweet + the responses undearneath, it instead shows you the tweet, three responses and then other suggested tweets picked by an algorithm. This is an engagement-boosting device they have made that you should be aware of.
