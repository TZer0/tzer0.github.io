## As a crewmate

### Basic
- Never lie.
- Make sure to vote (including skip vote), else a sneaky impostor might vote just before the timer expires.
- Avoid piling on top of others on common tasks. Sneaky impostors might try to get a kill in the stack.
- Unless it is 100% certain who killed, do not vote when there are seven people left (and two impostors). This leaves you at six, which means that the impostors can sabotage a couple of seconds before the meeting cooldown ends and then mash the kill-buttons for a double-kill. If three people vouch, it still might be worth the risk. Voting at four with one impostor is also dangerous and will end the game once people know how to play.
- if you are at five or six people left with two impostors, you have to vote. Anything else leaves you open to a kill/double-kill victory.
- Generally assume that someone accusing someone else and saying definitive things such as "they vented" or "they killed X" was speaking the truth if they end up dead between meetings. Be careful following this advice outside of playing with people you know as strangers do weird things in pubs.
- Are the impostors going for a double-kill against four crewmates to end the game during a sabotage? Mash R and you might catch them killing one person before the second person dies.

### Advanced
- When you report a body, consider asking where everyone is before revealing where the body was found. This can be exploited by impostors too to frame someone, but can also let you catch a lying impostor.
- Think carefully when you want to confirm someone as innocent. Do it too early and the impostors will target you and them because the fewer confirmed innocent people are a meeting, the better it is for them.

## As an impostor

### Basic
- Don't stay quiet during meetings. Even if you literally saw no one or you have a sus story, tell people a story of where you were because it is more sus if you stay quiet.
- If you somehow find yourself at 5 or 6 people alive, 2 impostors, wait a bit for the meeting timer to go down, cause a outage of a sort and go for a (double-)kill.
- On maps like Polus, the layout can be exploited when there are 6 left. Sabotage reactor, go to left stabiliser. If others approach it segmented, kill one crewmate as close as possible to the reset button and get the other kill further away.
- Careful causing crises if you're a dead impostor. Maybe mess with doors to cause suspicion, but keep it to that. You don't know what your fellow impostor is planning.
- If you somehow are left at 6 (with two of you alive), find one person each and time the kills with the kill cooldown reset.

### Advanced
- You generally want to kill people who are confirmed innocent. The more people suspicion can fall on during a meeting, the better for you.
- Learn the common tasks (and fake them) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdaoa8BAmV0). If one person has them, everyone does. Don't move in on them in spawn until at couple of people do.
- For the final showdown in a 3 v 1, you have effectively two strategies. If everyone is still scattering, try to kill people off in each their own corner of the map, if you're going together then you must cause enough confusion that you are alone with three people for even a moment, stab one and blame it on the other person. If you can, kill the most trustworthy person and leave the person who has been the most suspicious recently and throughout the game alive (if two people leave you alone, kill the person who left first, etc.). Self-reporting is totally valid here.

## Other tips

- Use the ingame chat if you're dead if you still want to listen in on the conversations of the living over voice chat.

## How settings affect the game

- Confirm ejects should get turned off as people get more experienced with the game. With confirm ejects on, you can't as an impostor really get away if someone accuses you of killing someone or venting.
- Visual tasks should also get turned off as well when people get more experience because it being on makes it too easy to clear people as not impostors.
- Hiding the taskbar/making it update during meetings makes it easier for impostors to fake tasks. It is in my opinion something that should be done because it helps newbie impostors fake tasks.

## Q&A


**Q: How do I fake doing a task as an impostor?**

A: This takes a bit of experience, but in general the way you do it is that you stand at a station with a fakeable task until the global completion progress bar moves while someone is watching you do it. Careful to not move too early or too late (depending on the task). Don't try to fake doing a very short task (such as pressing a button) or visual tasks (such as doing asteroids). With the taskbar off/update on meeting, make sure to stand still for long enough to make it plausible.


**Q: Wait, if I saw someone kill and there's seven people left, why should we not vote the impostor out?**

A: It comes down to how well you can persuade your fellow crewmates. The risks are rather high - if you fail to convince your fellow crewmates the game is effectively over and it is your word against the impostor's. It is therefore better to hard accuse someone and still skip if only you saw the kill happen. After all: the impostor has guaranteed one person on their side which means that they only need to convince two crewmates to vote you off.

## Suggested additional rules

- On Polus it should not be allowed to ask which keyhole you had in the key common task. Reason: the order is determined by the order in which people joined the server. This means you can be caught out once by this and on top of this: people joining the server late won't be able to do it.

## What are my options in terms of playing this game?

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) - Costs roughly 3 EUR, officially it works on Windows, but Proton seems to run this flawlessly on Linux as well. You can also check [isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/amongus/info/) for cheaper deals out there.
- [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) - Free, android emulator. Works on Windows and Mac.
