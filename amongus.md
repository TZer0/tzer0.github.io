As a crewmate-
-
- Unless it is 100% certain who killed, do not vote when there are 7 people left (and two impostors). This leaves you at 6, which means that the impostors can sabotage a couple of seconds before the meeting cooldown ends and then mash the kill-buttons for a double-kill. If three people vouch, it still might be worth the risk. Voting at four with one impostor is also dangerous and will end the game.
- if you are at 5 or 6 people left with two impostors, you have to vote. Anything else leaves you open to a kill/double-kill victory.
- Never lie.
- When you report a body, consider asking where everyone is before revealing where the body was found. This can be exploited by impostors too to frame someone, but can also let you catch a lying impostor.
- Avoid piling on top of others on common tasks. Sneaky impostors might try to get a kill in the stack.
- Generally assume that someone accusing someone else and saying definitive things such as "they vented" or "they killed X" was speaking the truth if they end up dead between meetings. Be careful following this advice outside of this server as people do weird shit in pubs.
- Are the impostors going for a double-kill against four crewmates to end the game during a sabotage? Mash R and you might catch them killing one person before the second person dies.
