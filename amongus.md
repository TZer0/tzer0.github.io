As a crewmate
-
- Unless it is 100% certain who killed, do not vote when there are 7 people left (and two impostors). This leaves you at 6, which means that the impostors can sabotage a couple of seconds before the meeting cooldown ends and then mash the kill-buttons for a double-kill. If three people vouch, it still might be worth the risk. Voting at four with one impostor is also dangerous and will end the game once people know how to play.
- if you are at 5 or 6 people left with two impostors, you have to vote. Anything else leaves you open to a kill/double-kill victory.
- Never lie.
- When you report a body, consider asking where everyone is before revealing where the body was found. This can be exploited by impostors too to frame someone, but can also let you catch a lying impostor.
- Avoid piling on top of others on common tasks. Sneaky impostors might try to get a kill in the stack.
- Generally assume that someone accusing someone else and saying definitive things such as "they vented" or "they killed X" was speaking the truth if they end up dead between meetings. Be careful following this advice outside of this server as people do weird things in pubs.
- Are the impostors going for a double-kill against four crewmates to end the game during a sabotage? Mash R and you might catch them killing one person before the second person dies.

As an impostor
-
- Don't stay quiet during meetings. Even if you literally saw no one or you have a sus story, tell people a story of where you were because it is more sus if you stay quiet.
- Learn the common tasks (and fake them): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdaoa8BAmV0>. If one person has them, everyone does. Don't move in on them in spawn until at couple of people do.
- If you somehow find yourself at 5 or 6 people alive, 2 impostors, wait a bit for the meeting timer to go down, cause a outage of a sort and go for a (double-)kill.
- On maps like Polus, the layout can be exploited when there are 6 left. Sabotage reactor, go to left stabiliser. If others approach it segmented, kill one crewmate as close as possible to the reset button and get the other kill further away.
- Careful causing crises if you're a dead impostor. Maybe mess with doors to cause suspicion, but keep it to that. You don't know what your fellow impostor is planning.
- For the final showdown in a 3 v 1, you have effectively two strategies. If everyone is still scattering, try to kill people off in each their own corner of the map, if you're going together then you must cause enough confusion that you are alone with three people for even a moment, stab one and blame it on the other person. If you can, kill the most trustworthy person and leave the person who has been the most suspicious recently and throughout the game alive (if two people leave you alone, kill the person who left first, etc.). Self-reporting is totally valid here.
- If you somehow are left at 6 (with two of you alive), find one person each and time the kills with the kill cooldown reset.

Q&A

**Q: How do I fake doing a task as an impostor?**

A: This takes a bit of experience, but in general the way you do it is that you stand at a station with a fakeable task until the global completion progress bar moves while someone is watching you do it. Careful to not move too early or too late (depending on the task). Don't try to fake doing a very short task (such as pressing a button) or visual tasks (such as doing asteroids)
