This is a list of information I want to keep online for easy sharing. I got fed up updating this information in every place I posted it, so it is now centrally hosted here instead.

If you make a pull request with changes to a document and it gets accepted or you send me suggestions through Discord (TZer0#9372), I'll credit you in the respective documents as a contributor if you'd like. You can also choose to link your socials in that case.
This is by no means a guarantee and I reserve my right to remove this at any point, but will only do so in cases where contributors turn out to be horrible people.

Dates are always YYYY.MM.DD
